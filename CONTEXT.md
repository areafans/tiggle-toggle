### ✅ PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED (September 24, 2025)

#### Use Case 3 COMPLETED: LaunchDarkly Experimentation with Performance Kill Switch
1. **✅ Fixed Metric Name Mismatch**
   - Changed `'ai-response-time'` to `'latency'` to match LaunchDarkly experiment
   - Experiment can now properly collect data from the app
   - Real experiment tracking via `ldClient.track('latency', user, { value: latencyMs })`

2. **✅ Performance-Based Flag Control Implementation**
   - Real LaunchDarkly API calls to enable/disable `f2-ai-chatbot` flag
   - Automatic kill switch: >500ms latency triggers flag disable
   - Automatic recovery: <300ms latency triggers flag enable
   - Preserves existing targeting rules (Alex & Sam get AI, Jordan doesn't)

3. **✅ Compelling Demo Flow**
   - "Simulate Spike" button triggers high latency (600-900ms)
   - Automated LaunchDarkly API response disables AI globally
   - "Restore Performance" button normalizes latency (80-200ms)
   - Automated LaunchDarkly API response re-enables AI for eligible users

   - LaunchDarkly experiment "AI Chatbot Performance Test" collects all latency data
   - Demonstrates data-driven feature management
   - Shows automated circuit breaker protecting user experience

### ✅ COMPLETED (September 23, 2025)

#### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **✅ Fixed Cross-Flag Contamination Bug**
   - Dashboard now uses pure LaunchDarkly flag evaluation (no demo overrides)
   - User switching calls `clearAllOverrides()` to prevent state pollution
   - Advanced Analytics toggle isolated from AI Chatbot behavior

2. **✅ Resolved Flag Key Mismatches**
   - Updated `FEATURE_FLAGS` constants to match LaunchDarkly SDK camelCase format
   - API calls use kebab-case, SDK reads camelCase - mapping maintained correctly
   - Fixed Advanced Analytics button functionality

3. **✅ Removed Demo Reset Feature**
   - As requested for cleaner demo experience
   - Advanced Analytics now uses real LaunchDarkly API calls

4. **✅ AI Chatbot Implementation Complete**
   - Full interactive chatbot component with targeting-based visibility
   - Responsive to user role switching and flag targeting
   - Model selection integration with AI state

5. **✅ LaunchDarkly Experimentation & Automatic Rollback System**
   - Created custom "AI Response Latency" metric in LaunchDarkly dashboard
   - Set up real A/B experiment testing AI chatbot performance impact
   - Built automatic rollback system simulating APM monitoring with flag triggers
   - Continuous data flow to LaunchDarkly experiment every 3 seconds
   - Kill switch functionality: automatically disables AI when latency > 500ms
   - Auto-recovery: re-enables AI when latency normalizes below 300ms

## LaunchDarkly Demo Scenarios

### Primary Demo Flow
1. **Guarded Rollout**: Toggle Advanced Analytics feature on/off instantly
2. **User Targeting**: Switch to Beta User → AI Chatbot appears automatically
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Trigger latency spike → Auto-rollback AI feature (REAL)
4. **Experimentation**: View live metrics flowing to LaunchDarkly experiment dashboard
5. **Configuration Management**: Switch AI models (GPT-4 ↔ Claude ↔ Gemini)
6. **Integration Status**: Show Slack integration as always connected

### Feature Flags in LaunchDarkly
- `advanced-analytics` (Boolean) - Controls new analytics dashboard [**LIVE**]
- `f2-ai-chatbot` (Boolean) - Controls AI assistant visibility with targeting [**LIVE**] [**EXPERIMENT**]
- `ai-model-config` (String) - Controls which AI model to use
- `slack-integration` (Boolean) - Mock integration status

### LaunchDarkly Experimentation Setup
- **Custom Metric**: "AI Response Latency" - tracks performance impact of AI chatbot
- **Experiment**: A/B test comparing AI chatbot ON vs OFF performance
- **Automatic Rollback**: Flag triggers based on performance thresholds
- **Data Flow**: Continuous metrics every 3 seconds simulating real APM monitoring

### User Targeting Rules [**CONFIGURED**]
- `f2-ai-chatbot` targets users where `role = "beta-user"` OR `role = "lab-owner"`
- Individual targeting for `user1` and `user2`
- Rule-based targeting for beta users and admin access levels
- Standard users (Jordan Kim) excluded from AI chatbot access

## Technical Architecture

### Key Dependencies
```json
{
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.x",
  "launchdarkly-react-client-sdk": "^3.x",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.0",
  "lucide-react": "^0.x",
  "class-variance-authority": "^0.x",
  "clsx": "^2.x"
}
```

### Project Structure Rationale
- **Components**: Reusable UI components following Shadcn/ui patterns
- **Contexts**: React Context for authentication and global state
- **Lib**: Utility functions, LaunchDarkly configuration, and experiment tracking
- **Pages**: Route-based page components with realistic mock data

### New Files Added
- `src/lib/experimentTracker.ts` - LaunchDarkly experiment integration and metrics tracking

### Performance Considerations
- LaunchDarkly flags cached in localStorage for faster subsequent loads
- Shadcn/ui components optimized for tree-shaking
- TailwindCSS purged for production builds

## Demo Presentation Tips

### Setup Before Demo
1. Ensure `npm start` is running and app loads at `localhost:3000`
2. Open demo control panel to verify all controls work
3. Test user switching and feature flag toggles
4. Have LaunchDarkly dashboard open in separate tab
5. Prepare browser window for screen sharing

### Demo Script Highlights
- **Start as Lab Owner** - Show full platform capabilities including AI chatbot
- **Toggle Advanced Analytics** - Demonstrate instant feature rollout via real API
- **Switch to Beta User** - Show targeted feature delivery (AI remains visible)
- **Switch to Standard User** - Show AI chatbot disappears (targeting rules)
- **Trigger Performance Spike** - Watch automatic rollback disable AI chatbot
- **Fix Performance** - Watch automatic recovery re-enable AI chatbot
- **Show LaunchDarkly Dashboard** - View live experiment metrics flowing in
- **AI Model Switching** - Configuration management capabilities

### Common Demo Pain Points
- Network latency to LaunchDarkly CDN may delay flag updates
- Browser caching might prevent immediate UI updates (refresh if needed)
- Demo control panel is only visible to presenter (intentional)

## Development Environment

### Current Setup
- **Node.js**: v18+ recommended
- **Development Server**: `npm start` on port 3000
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Linting**: ESLint with React hooks plugin

### Known Issues
- TailwindCSS v4 causes PostCSS conflicts (stick to v3.4.x)
- Some ESLint warnings for unused imports (non-blocking)
- Create React App deprecation warnings (cosmetic)

## Implementation Architecture

### Key Technical Components
1. **Automatic Rollback System** (`src/components/DemoControlPanel.tsx:151-197`)
   - APM monitoring simulation with 3-second intervals
   - Kill switch logic: disables AI when latency > 500ms
   - Auto-recovery: re-enables AI when latency < 300ms
   - Real LaunchDarkly API calls for flag triggers

2. **Experiment Data Tracking** (`src/lib/experimentTracker.ts`)
   - `SimpleExperimentTracker` class with `trackResponseTime()` method
   - Sends real latency data to LaunchDarkly experiment
   - Custom "ai-response-time" event with user context

3. **Performance Visualization** (`src/components/DemoControlPanel.tsx:306-363`)
   - Real-time latency chart with color-coded thresholds
   - Live experiment data display
   - Spike/Fix buttons for demonstration scenarios
