# ToggleLab Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers deploying ToggleLab to Vercel for public demonstrations and stakeholder access.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account (free tier available)
- LaunchDarkly account with configured flags
- OpenAI API key

## Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup

The repository is already configured for Vercel deployment with:
- `vercel.json` configuration file
- `.env.example` template
- Auto-deployment ready React build

### 2. Vercel Project Creation

#### Option A: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import from GitHub repository
4. Select your ToggleLab fork/repository

#### Option B: Vercel CLI
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
# Follow the prompts to link your project
```

### 3. Environment Variables Configuration

In your Vercel project dashboard, add these environment variables:

#### Required Variables
```bash
# LaunchDarkly Configuration
REACT_APP_LD_CLIENT_SIDE_ID=your-client-side-id
LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY=your-server-sdk-key

# OpenAI Configuration (for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
```

#### How to Add Variables in Vercel
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add each variable with appropriate values
4. Ensure variables are enabled for Production, Preview, and Development

### 4. Build Configuration

ToggleLab is pre-configured with:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "build" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This configuration:
- Builds the React app using `npm run build`
- Serves the static files from the `build` directory
- Handles client-side routing with fallback to `index.html`

### 5. Deployment Process

#### Automatic Deployment
- Push to your main branch triggers automatic deployment
- Vercel builds and deploys automatically
- Environment variables are injected at build time

#### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy from local machine
vercel --prod

# Or redeploy latest from dashboard
# Click "Redeploy" in Vercel dashboard
```

### 6. Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify these features work:

#### 6.1 LaunchDarkly Integration
- [ ] Feature flags load correctly
- [ ] User targeting works (Jordan Kim doesn't see AI)
- [ ] Flag toggles update in real-time
- [ ] Console shows LaunchDarkly SDK activity

#### 6.2 Demo Functionality
- [ ] User switching works
- [ ] Advanced Analytics toggle functional
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] AI chatbot appears for appropriate users

#### 6.3 Performance
- [ ] Initial page load < 3 seconds
- [ ] Flag evaluation < 1 second
- [ ] Smooth user switching
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile

## Live Demo URL Structure

Your deployed demo will be available at:
```
https://your-project-name.vercel.app
```

### Sharing with Stakeholders

Create a simple access guide:

```markdown
# ToggleLab Live Demo Access

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**: https://your-project-name.vercel.app

## Quick Demo Steps:
1. **User Targeting**: Switch between users in demo controls
2. **Feature Rollout**: Toggle "F1 - Advanced Analytics"
3. **Performance Kill Switch**: Click "Spike Latency" to see circuit breaker
4. **AI Model Assignment**: Notice auto-assigned models per user

## Users Available:
- **Alex Chen** (Lab Owner): Full access, GPT-3.5-Turbo
- **Sam Rivera** (Beta User): AI access, GPT-3.5-16k
- **Jordan Kim** (Standard User): No AI access (targeting demo)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

#### 1. Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
# Common issues:
- Missing environment variables
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Missing dependencies
```

#### 2. LaunchDarkly Connection Issues
- Verify `REACT_APP_LD_CLIENT_SIDE_ID` is correct
- Check LaunchDarkly dashboard for connection logs
- Ensure environment variables are set for production

#### 3. Environment Variables Not Loading
- Variables must be prefixed with `REACT_APP_` for client-side access
- Redeploy after adding new environment variables
- Check Vercel function logs for server-side variables

### Performance Optimization

#### 4.1 Bundle Size
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

#### 4.2 Caching
Vercel automatically configures:
- Static asset caching (CSS, JS, images)
- CDN distribution
- Gzip compression

## Monitoring

### Vercel Analytics
Enable Vercel Analytics for:
- Page view tracking
- Performance metrics
- User engagement data

### LaunchDarkly Insights
Monitor in LaunchDarkly dashboard:
- Flag evaluation counts
- User targeting distribution
- Feature adoption metrics

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit actual keys to repository
- Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables
- Rotate keys regularly

### API Keys
- LaunchDarkly Client-side ID: Safe for browser exposure
- LaunchDarkly SDK Key: Server-side only (for AI Config)
- OpenAI API Key: Server-side only, implement rate limiting

## Scaling Considerations

### Performance
- Current setup handles 100+ concurrent users
- LaunchDarkly CDN provides global distribution
- Vercel Edge Functions for optimal response times

### Feature Flags
- Production deployment can use same LaunchDarkly project
- Separate environments (Test/Production) recommended
- Flag archival strategy for unused flags
